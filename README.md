# ðŸ“š Book Recommendation System

A project demonstrating how Large Language Models (LLMs) and vector search can power intelligent book recommendations.

---

##  Project Components

- **Cleaned** text data: `data-exploration.ipynb`  
- **Built** a vector database for semantic search: `vector-search.ipynb`  
- **Classified** books as fiction or non-fiction using zero-shot LLMs: `text-classification.ipynb`  
- **Analyzed** sentiment and extracted emotions with LLMs: `sentiment-analysis.ipynb`  
- **Created** a Gradio web app for book recommendations: `gradio-dashboard.py`  

---

##  Features

-  **Semantic Search**: find books similar to natural language queries (e.g., *"a book about a person seeking revenge"*)  
-  **Classification**: filter books by fiction or non-fiction  
-  **Sentiment Analysis**: sort books by tone (suspenseful, joyful, sad, etc.)  
-  **Web Dashboard**: explore and interact with recommendations through a Gradio app
